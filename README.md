# Coat Hanger Design
I designed a coat hanger using the tools shell, fillet, extrude, and sweep. This coat hanger is a practical item used for organizing clothes, preventing wrinkles, and saving closet space.

Tools Used:
Extrude: To create the base and main parts of the hanger.
Sweep: To draw the curved edge that forms the hook.
Fillet: To smooth the edges and enhance the aesthetic appearance.
Shell: To make the hanger lightweight and functional.

# Cup/Pen Holder Design
I designed a cup that can also be used as a pen holder. I measured its dimensions using a simple ruler to ensure accuracy.

Tools Used:
Extrude: To create the main body of the cup.
Shell: To thin out the walls for practicality.
Fillet: To smooth the edges and avoid sharp corners.
